# Beginnings
This collection contains some of the first projects I ever made on my own. 

My first programming class taught Pascal as a programming language. While not very modern, it offered all the basics and even had a graphic library to draw primatives. The first real real-time game I ever made is [FalconX](https://github.com/Lexdysic/beginnings/tree/master/FalconX), a top-down arcade shooter.
